# python-api-challenge
Module 6 Challenge repo

My scripts are in the /WeatheryPy directory as WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb.  The starter files are there, too, as -starter versions of the same.

My outputs are in the WeatherPy/output_data/ directory as a .csv file and four image files of plots.
